dead! she's nomore...

*reason* : Maria's friend suggested her,"Should we try new beauty trend Maria? They inject cooking oil in diffrent body parts. It gives them thickness & shapes beautifully!".

Inspite of risks, Maria agreed.
Cooking oil was injected into Marias Buttocks.
Unfortunately, it resulted in multiple organ failure. Fat blockages were formed in her body tissues & veins.

That is how sensitive our human body is to oil. Wrong cooking oil in our kitchen, will eventually cause painful health problems to our children!

- Vegetable oil undergoes hydrogenation to maintain food taste and smell stability.
- Even small doses of hydrogenated vegetable oil can pose dangers.
- This process solidifies liquid unsaturated fat, meeting consumer demand for longer shelf life.
- However, it leads to excessive trans fatty acid production, which is harmful.
- High temperatures, pressure, and chemical solvents are employed in vegetable oil extraction.
- This extraction process may result in oils becoming rancid, corroded, and losing quality.
- Consequently, these oils can be considered toxic.
- Consumption of such oils may decrease blood flow, increasing the risk of various *disorders* including *shortness of breath*, *chest pain*, and *coronary artery disease*.
- Complete blockage of blood flow could lead to a *heart attack*.
- Stroke risk can arise from plaque ruptures *blocking brain blood* flow.
- Health concerns have led many to adopt oil-free diets.
- When following an oil-free diet, it's crucial to ensure sufficient intake of essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins.
- Unrefined fats, particularly those supporting immune and endocrine systems and promoting bone health, are vital for a healthy lifestyle.
- Fats and oils aid in the absorption of nutrients from meals.
